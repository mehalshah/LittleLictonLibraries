        War and Peace may be intimidating in length, but don't be dissuaded. The prose is fun, accessible, and action-packed. And there aren't _that_ many characters. If you could handle Game of Thrones, this will be no problem.

        Jurassic Park was the first grown-up book I ever read. It's considerably darker than the film adaptation, and is more of a horror-thriller than epic romp.
